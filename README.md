This is very simple apps that allows you to remotely control a windows app by sending commands into active application.
I'm using it in order to control my second game instance for Warhammer: Return of Reckoning.

Full use case:
1) Configure ingame macroses and skills panel. Now it uses 6 different commands
2) Launch client app, set remote computer address
3) Launch server app, make warhammer window game active
4) On your client use F1-F6 keys to send commands

Current version is hardcoded for healer. Where F1 - follow party leader, F2 - heal party leader, F3 - group heal, F4 - attack on assist, F5 - idle
